## Introduction
From the team here at 41 North, welcome aboard! We aim to build the kind of products that we want to exist in the world — things that are a joy to use, fairly priced, and (most importantly) respectful of your data and privacy.

We’ve tried to take a similar approach with the policies that you are bound to when you use and interact with our products. These policies help us comply with laws from different countries and jurisdictions around the globe, but are (hopefully) written as clearly and fairly as we can make them.

We welcome your [feedback and questions](../contact/index.md) with regards to these policies, or just in general.

## Updates
We do our best to notify you when these policies have major changes, via in-app messaging, email, etc. However, if you'd like to stay in the loop on all changes, you can subscribe to activity notifications on GitHub.  [:material-arrow-right: Learn how here](updates.md)
