## Sign up to receive update notifications

You can subscribe to activity notifications to know when our policies change. Here's how:

2. Visit our Policies repository at [https://github.com/41-north/policies](https://github.com/41-north/policies).
3. Click the "Watch" button at the top right corner of the page.
4. Choose the notification settings you want. If you want to keep things simple, just select "All Activity."

That's it! You'll get notifications for any activity that happens in that repository. You can change your notification settings or stop getting notifications by clicking the "Watch" button again.

!!! question "Basecamp? 37signals?"
    Keen observers may notice the gif above references Basecamp and 37signals. Like many of these policies, this Updates page (and accompanying gif) were ~~stolen~~ borrowed from the [Basecamp open-source policies](https://github.com/basecamp/policies) / [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

    Eventually we'll get around to making our own gif, but there are plenty of other things to work on right now.
