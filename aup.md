# Acceptable Use Policy

> *Last updated 2024-11-26*

## Introduction
Your use of the 41 North Services is subject to our [Terms of Service](terms.md) and this Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). In a nutshell, 41 North reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account, with or without notice, and in its sole discretion.

We would love to give an exhaustive list of ok and not-ok activities, but folks are creative and we can’t predict everything they’ll come up with. Generally speaking, however, don’t do anything on the 41 North Services that negatively impacts 41 North, other customers, or third parties.

## Unacceptable Uses
In general, you agree that you will not, in any combination and without limitation:  

- Collect or extract information and/or user data from accounts which do not belong to you.
- Circumvent, disable, or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Services.
- Trick, defraud, or mislead us or other users, including but not limited to making false reports or impersonating another user.
- Upload or transmit (or attempt to upload or to transmit) viruses or any type of malware, or information collection mechanism, including 1×1 pixels, web bugs, cookies, or other similar devices.
- Interfere with, disrupt, or create an undue burden on the Services or the networks or the Services connected.
- Harass, annoy, intimidate, or threaten others, or any of our employees engaged in providing any portion of the Services to you.
- Disparage, tarnish, or otherwise harm, in our opinion, us and/or the Services.
- Use the Services in a manner inconsistent with any applicable laws or regulations.
- Cause 41 North to be in violation of its terms and agreements with its service providers and subprocessors.
