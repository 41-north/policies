# 41 North Policies, Terms, and Legal Things

This GitHub repo contains copies of all of the 41 North policies, as listed at [https://policies.41n.co](https://policies.41n.co). You can view the revision history, and get notifications when changes are made to any of these policies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repo is **read-only**, and is updated from the source repo for the `about.41n.co` website. This repo is provided as a convenience, so that you can easily view revision history and sign up for activity notifications, without being notified any time *any* change is made to the 'about' site.

## A Note About Links and Formatting
You may notice that some of the hyperlinks in this repository don't actually take you anywhere, or take you somewhere silly. You may also find some items that aren't formatted properly, leading to something like `:octicons-link-24:` or `!!! warning`.

The short version is, we made a technical trade-off. Since our policies are initially written for our `about.41n.co` website, those files/pages are processed differently than the ones in this repo.

The slightly longer version: The `about.41n.co` site is written in Markdown with some specialty syntax that is processed by [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Since the files in this specific repo aren't processed the same way, GitHub doesn't know what to do with the specialty syntax and is just showing you gibberish.

You can always find the latest and greatest of these policies, with all their links and syntax working properly, over at [https://policies.41n.co](https://policies.41n.co).

## Many of These Policies Were ~~Stolen~~ Borrowed
Many of our policies have been adapted from the [Basecamp open-source policies](https://github.com/basecamp/policies) / [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you don’t see this attribution at the bottom of the doc, the page is our own.

We really appreciate that basecamp released these policies in the open. Small businesses releasing software on the internet are subject to a myriad of rules, regulations, and other concerns -- starting our policies from a place that has been vetted by a company with the size and reach of 37signals is really awesome.
